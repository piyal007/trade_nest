Assignment 11 - Requirements Mismatch Report

NOT DONE
 - 19. All cards should have the same border radius and be of the same size.
  Reason: Mixed radii used across components (e.g., rounded-lg, rounded-xl, rounded-2xl).

- 20. A maximum of two button types (outline and filled) used uniformly.
  Reason: Multiple button styles exist (gradients, solid fills, outlines, varied shapes).

PARTIALLY DONE

- 14. Handle system dark/light mode; no visibility issues.
  Reason: Dark mode and toggle work; system preference is applied only when no saved theme exists. Initial theme doesnâ€™t auto-follow system preference if a prior choice is stored.
